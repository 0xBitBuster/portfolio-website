# React.js Portfolio Website

![Showcase Image](https://i.ibb.co/5xYYDgb/Screenshot-1.png)

This is my personal portfolio website in Cartoon-Style, made with React.js & TailwindCSS. The whole design is made to be simple and eye-catching. You may use this as project as a starting point for your portfolio, but make sure you give this repo a star :)
